/**
 *  @abstract   SSTabView is a container for set of views or view controllers.
 *              Provides smooth animations while switching between visible tabs and for dynamic content modification.
 *              Basic layout shown below:
 *
 *  +------------+---+--------------+---+-------------+
 *  | LEFT ITEMS | < |   SECTIONS   | > | RIGHT ITEMS |  <-- SSNavigationStripView as a subview. Set during SSTabView initialization.
 *  +------------+---+--------------+---+-------------+
 *  |                                                 |
 *  |                                                 |
 *  |                      TABS                       |  <-- Content container. Tabs can be represented by subclasses of UIView or UIViewController.
 *  |                                                 |
